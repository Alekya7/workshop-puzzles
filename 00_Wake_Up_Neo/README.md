# Terraform Puzzle #0
## Wake Up Neo
**Challenge Level: Beginner**

```
Wake up, Neo...
```

### Background
üë®üèª‚Äçüíª You're working a boring job at the MetaCortex software company. While sitting in your cubicle and writing terraform code you receive a message on your terminal:

```
Install the cmatrix program using **local_exec** and wait for your next instruction...
```

### Setup
No special setup is required, all you need is terraform and internet access.

### The Challenge
Create a file called `main.tf` and write terraform code that installs the **cmatrix** package. On Ubuntu systems you can use the following command to get it installed:

```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt -y install cmatrix
```

HINT: You can utilize the [null resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/null_resource.html) to park your **local_exec** provisioner in.

Run the **cmatrix** program and see what happens.
